# MinitaurE_ROS
Package for manual and autonomous control of the Minitaur E from Ghost Robotics, using the Robot Operating System (ROS)

## Requirements
## Hardware
* This SDK was written with the assumption that the Minitaur E uses a SLAMETECH MAPPER M1M1 for navigation. 

## Software
* Create a machine running Ubuntu 18.04+
* [Install ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
* [Install the Ghost Robotics SDK](https://gitlab.com/ghostrobotics/SDK/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=deploy_artifact)
* You'll need TWO wifi capable adapters (One for connecting to the robot's onboard computer, and another for connecting to the LIDAR's wifi network)
